This is a proyect that allows you to have a record of the proteins and calories you eat, typing the option 2 of the menu. Just register new food in the text file with their name, protein quantity and calories. And then you can enter the food you ate to know the total calories and protein you have eaten, know the information of the registered food and classificate the registered food depending of their quantity of protein. 

The option 1 doesn't have any practical use. It's just a game that allows you to register new users, make them eat and exercise to change their protein and calorie levels
